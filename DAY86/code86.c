/*Problem: Find the integer square root of a given non-negative integer using Binary Search. The integer square root of a number is defined as the greatest integer whose square is less than or equal to the given number.

Input:
- First line: an integer n

Output:
- Print the integer square root of n

Examples:
Input:
64

Output:
8

Input:
20

Output:
4

Input:
1

Output:
1

Explanation:
Binary Search is applied on the range 0 to n. At each step, the middle value is squared and compared with n. If mid * mid equals n, mid is the square root. If mid * mid is less than n, search continues in the right half; otherwise, in the left half. The final answer is the largest integer whose square does not exceed n.*/
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    long long n;
    scanf("%lld", &n);

    long long left = 0, right = n, ans = 0;

    while (left <= right) {
        long long mid = (left + right) / 2;

        if (mid * mid == n) {
            ans = mid;
            break;
        } else if (mid * mid < n) {
            ans = mid;
            left = mid + 1;
        } else {
            right = mid - 1;
        }
    }

    printf("%lld", ans);
    return 0;
}
